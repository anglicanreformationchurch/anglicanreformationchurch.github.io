    <!-- About Us -->
    <section id="about">
      <h2 class="section-title">About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Anglican Reformation Church is a traditional and confessional Anglican church committed to the evangelical faith. As our name indicates, we stand in the tradition of the English Reformers 
		  and martyrs of the sixteenth century, who sought by biblical reformation to restore the Church to conformity with Holy Scripture and the teaching of the apostolic Church.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Our Beliefs -->
    <section id="beliefs">
      <h2 class="section-title">Our Beliefs</h2>
      <p>We hold to the ancient ecumenical creeds of the Christian faith:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Apostles’ Creed</li>
        <li>Nicene Creed</li>
        <li>Athanasian Creed</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We seek to model the love, fellowship, faith, and mission of 
the early church as described in the book of Acts and be united as a 
family in Christ Jesus. We are committed to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Placing Christ above ourselves and our culture.</li>
        <li>Shaping our engagement with one another and our culture by Biblical principles.</li>
        <li>Resisting what is incompatible to Christ in ourselves and our culture by Biblical principles (John 17:14–19).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We subscribe to the Reformational faith of the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion emphasizing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sola Scriptura</strong> – God’s inerrant word written, our sole authority over faith and practice. (Articles VI &amp; XX)</li>
        <li><strong>Solus Christus</strong> – Salvation through Christ alone. (Articles XV &amp; XVIII)</li>
        <li><strong>Sola Gratia</strong> – Salvation by grace alone. (Article X)</li>
        <li><strong>Sola Fide</strong> – Justification by grace through faith. (Article XI)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We worship reverently (Heb. 12:28–29) and liturgically, focusing
 on God (Soli Deo Gloria). We use the 1662 Book of Common Prayer and 
Christ-centered hymns and prayers.
      </p>

      <p>
        We reject sacerdotal views of ministry and affirm preaching, 
teaching, and pastoral oversight. We recognize only two sacraments 
ordained by Christ: Baptism and the Lord’s Supper (Articles XXV – XXXI).
      </p>

<section id="why-reformation">
	<h2 class="section-title">Why Are We Named "Reformation"?</h2>
		<p>That is a very good question! It is not a common name. Many Anglican churches incorporate the name of a saint (such as All Saints, Saint Botolph’s, or Saint George’s), while others use familiar Christian terms (such as Trinity, Christ, Resurrection, or Redemption). All of these are excellent choices.</p>
		<p>In Great Britain, where Anglicanism was born, and throughout the global Anglican Communion, it has long been understood that the Anglican Church is a Protestant Reformed church, birthed out of the Protestant Reformation—specifically the English Reformation—which emphasized the authority of Holy Scripture alone over tradition and salvation by faith alone rather than by works.</p>
		<p> Even today, when a new sovereign of England is crowned, as King Charles III recently was, the monarch must take an oath that includes these words:</p>
		<p>“Will you to the utmost of your power maintain in the United Kingdom the Protestant Reformed Religion established by law?”</p>
		<p>In North America, however, this historical reality is less widely known, having been obscured by revisionist tendencies within the more liberal and eclectic parts of the Episcopal Church. Why?</p>
		<p>The word Reformation means “to restore something to its original form or condition.” In terms of the Church, reformation means restoring beliefs and practices that have drifted away from the standard and primary authority of God’s Word.</p>
		<p>We chose the name <em>Reformation</em> to remind us of our origins in the English Reformation and of the many hundreds of English martyrs who died for the Gospel of Jesus Christ at the hands of Rome—especially the fathers and architects of the Anglican faith: William Tyndale, Thomas Cranmer, Hugh Latimer, and Nicholas Ridley.</p>
		<p>Here at Reformation, we hope to build a church family that faithfully adheres to the authority of the Bible and that, together with the prophets, apostles, and martyrs, reverently worships Jesus Christ as Lord and boldly proclaims His Gospel to a lost and dying world.</p>
